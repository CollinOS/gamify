## GAMIFY

## notes & stuff

- maybe need a grid instead of row with 2 cols for skills

what if I turned it into kinda like a game. the HomeHero appears after the loading screen.
then after hitting button it starts typing some rp dialogue as if year is 2049 and in this reality.
then as you hit next it takes you through pages to build your skill card
- color scheme inspired by the KD Energy shoes that came out my freshman year of high school
