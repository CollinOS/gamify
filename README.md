## GAMIFY

This project stimmed from a late night conversation with friends about how to find more joy in the little things in life.
Throughout the conversation we came up with a way to "gamify" life in a way to make things feel more fun and rewarding.
This is my interpretation of what that idea could look like in a real world situation, with a dystopian twist.

## notes & stuff

what if I turned it into kinda like a game. the HomeHero appears after the loading screen.
then after hitting button it starts typing some rp dialogue as if year is 2049 and in this reality.
then as you hit next it takes you through pages to build your skill card
